//! Runtime-selectable Isolation Backend contract (RFC 0012).
//!
//! This module is the object-safe, runtime-selectable contract the supervisor
//! role drives. A backend registers an [`IsolationBackend`] under a
//! `backend_name`; the supervisor resolves it from a [`BackendRegistry`]
//! against the admitted backend name and advances the boundary through a fixed
//! chain of boxed states:
//!
//! ```text
//! attach backend descriptor + sandbox context -> Bound -> confirm -> Ready
//!     -> start_agent -> Running
//! ```
//!
//! Each transition consumes the prior state by value (`self: Box<Self>`).
//! Trusted backend implementations construct confirmation through a validating
//! constructor; the supervisor cannot obtain a ready boundary without confirmed
//! backend-neutral enforcement properties.
//! The supervisor holds no `match`/downcast on concrete backends: the
//! registry is the only lookup by `backend_name`, and everything past it is a
//! `Box<dyn _>` / `Arc<dyn _>`.
//!
//! `attach` is atomic from the caller's perspective: it establishes and binds
//! the boundary, returns `Bound`, or fails closed. It never binds a resource
//! already bound to an active boundary. Binary identity travels on every
//! [`PendingTcpOpen`], resolved for that exact socket and process
//! generation; an unresolved identity denies the open.
//!
//! The contract is transport-neutral. Compute drivers keep runtime placement
//! and coordination details behind these interfaces.
