//! L7 protocol provider trait.
//!
//! Each application protocol (REST, SQL) implements this trait to provide
//! request parsing, relay, and deny response generation.
//!
//! Uses generic `AsyncRead + AsyncWrite` stream bounds so the same provider
//! works for both plaintext TCP and TLS-terminated connections.
