 * - `undefined` = no restrictions (allow all reads)
 * - `{denyOnly: []}` = no restrictions (empty deny list = allow all reads)
 * - `{denyOnly: [...paths]}` = deny reads from these paths, allow all others
 * - `{denyOnly: [...paths], allowWithinDeny: [...paths]}` = deny reads from
 *   denyOnly paths, but re-allow reads within allowWithinDeny paths.
 *   Most-specific entry wins: an allowWithinDeny path re-opens the denied
 *   region it sits inside, while a denyOnly entry that is itself more
 *   specific than the allow it lands in — a literal nested under an
 *   allowed directory, or a glob such as `**\/.env` matching files inside
 *   one — stays denied.
 *
 * This is maximally permissive by default - only explicitly denied paths are blocked.

 * - `unsetEnvVars`: environment variable names to unset inside the sandbox.
 * - `setEnvVars`: environment variables to set inside the sandbox to a
 *   sentinel value (overrides the inherited real value).
 * - `maskedFileBinds`: (realPath → fakePath) pairs for whole-file masking;
 *   the platform layer binds fakePath over realPath read-only so the
 *   sandbox reads a sentinel instead of the real bytes (Linux only —
 *   macOS degrades these to denyReadPaths).
 * - `maskedFileStoreDir`: host directory holding the fake files. The
 *   Linux layer ro-binds it over itself so the sandbox cannot tamper
 *   with the bind sources regardless of allowWrite.
 * - `degradeToDenyPaths`: the subset of `denyReadPaths` that the library
 *   resolved itself — a masked file whose extract pattern matched nothing
 *   under `onExtractNoMatch: "deny"`. Each names one file that was opened,
 *   so backends must apply it literally rather than as a pattern.

/**
 * Network restriction config (internal structure built from permission rules).
 *
 * This uses an "allow-only" pattern (like write restrictions):
 * - `allowedHosts` = hosts that are explicitly allowed
 * - `deniedHosts` = hosts that are explicitly denied (checked first, before allowedHosts)
 *
 * Semantics:
 * - `undefined` allowedHosts = no allowlist configured
 * - `{allowedHosts: [], deniedHosts: []}` = allowlist configured with zero entries
 * - `{allowedHosts: [...], deniedHosts: [...]}` = apply allow/deny rules
 *
 * Note: Empty `allowedHosts` means no host matches an allow rule (unlike
 * read's empty denyOnly). Whether an unmatched host is denied outright
 * depends on the ask callback: deniedHosts are checked first and deny
 * unconditionally; a host matching neither list falls through to the
 * registered SandboxAskCallback when one exists, and is denied only when
 * no callback is registered. Hosts needing a hard block-all regardless of
 * callback behavior should use a `deniedHosts` wildcard.
 *
 * Entries are the raw config patterns and may carry an optional `:port`
 * suffix (`api.example.com:443`, `*:22`) meaning "this rule applies only
 * to that destination port". Consumers matching hosts themselves should
 * parse the suffix (see `splitDomainPatternPort`) rather than compare the
 * whole string; a deny-all check must accept `*:<port>` as well as `*`.
