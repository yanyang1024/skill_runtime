"""Deterministic attester for Attested Computations with runtime: bigquery.

Verifies two things about a receipt produced by skills/run-on-bq.md:

  1. Provenance: the SQL that actually ran (`receipt.executed_sql`) equals the
     computation body of the concept (or the file at `computation:`) after
     normalizing whitespace, casing of keywords, and comment stripping.
     Named bind variables (@name) are compared symbolically; their values are
     not inspected here (the executor is trusted to bind).

  2. Fidelity: the value the caller displayed to the user (`claimed_value`)
     equals the first cell of `receipt.result`.

Returns a verdict dict:
  { "ok": bool, "reason": str | None, "details": { ... } }

Never uses an LLM. Never makes network calls. Safe to run consumer-side.
