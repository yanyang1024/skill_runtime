 *
 * N-day active users = users who have logged at least one event with event param 
 * engagement_time_msec > 0 in the last N days.
*/

SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS n_day_active_users_count
FROM
  `YOUR_TABLE.events_*` AS T
    CROSS JOIN
      T.event_params
WHERE
  event_params.key = 'engagement_time_msec' AND event_params.value.int_value > 0
  -- Pick events in the last N = 20 days.
  AND event_timestamp >
      UNIX_MICROS(TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, INTERVAL 20 DAY))
  AND _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20180521' AND '20240131';
