Builds an audience of N-Day Inactive Users. Inactive users are defined as those active in the last M days (e.g. 7 days) who have NOT logged any event with event parameter `engagement_time_msec > 0` in the last N days (e.g. 2 days), where M > N.

# Schema
This reference describes a query pattern and does not map to a single database schema.

# Common query patterns

```sql
/**
 * Builds an audience of N-Day Inactive Users.
 *
 * N-Day inactive users = users in the last M days who have not logged one  
 * event with event param engagement_time_msec > 0 in the last N days 
 *  where M > N.
 */
