/**
 * Reusable strategies for reducing many values into one value. A `Reducer<A>`
 * extends `Combiner.Combiner` with an `initialValue` for empty collections and
 * a `combineAll` method for folding an entire iterable. This module provides a
 * constructor for reducers and a helper for reversing the order in which values
 * are combined.
 *
 * @since 4.0.0
 */
/**
 * Creates a `Reducer` from a `combine` function and an `initialValue`.
 *
 * **When to use**
 *
 * Use when you have a custom reducing operation not covered by a pre-built reducer.
 * - You want to provide an optimized `combineAll` (e.g. short-circuiting on
 *   a known absorbing element like `0` for multiplication).
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * - If `combineAll` is omitted, a default left-to-right fold starting from
 *   `initialValue` is used.
 * - If `combineAll` is provided, it completely replaces the default fold.
 *
 * **Example** (Multiplying with short-circuit)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Reducer } from "effect"
 *
 * const Product = Reducer.make<number>(
 *   (a, b) => a * b,
 *   1,
 *   (collection) => {
 *     let acc = 1
 *     for (const n of collection) {
 *       if (n === 0) return 0
 *       acc *= n
 *     }
 *     return acc
 *   }
 * )
 *
 * console.log(Product.combineAll([2, 3, 4]))
 * // Output: 24
 *
 * console.log(Product.combineAll([2, 0, 4]))
 * // Output: 0
 * ```
 *

 * @see {@link flip} – reverse the argument order

/**
 * Reverses the argument order of a reducer's `combine` method.
 *
 * **When to use**
 *
 * Use when you want the right-hand value to act as the accumulator, or need to
 * reverse a non-commutative reducer such as string concatenation.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * - Returns a new `Reducer` where `combine(self, that)` calls the original
 *   reducer as `combine(that, self)`.
 * - The `initialValue` is preserved from the original reducer.
 * - The `combineAll` is re-derived from the flipped `combine` (using the
 *   default left-to-right fold), not carried over from the original.
 *
 * **Example** (Reversing string concatenation)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Reducer, String } from "effect"
 *
 * const Prepend = Reducer.flip(String.ReducerConcat)
 *
 * console.log(Prepend.combine("a", "b"))
 * // Output: "ba"
 *
 * console.log(Prepend.combineAll(["a", "b", "c"]))
 * // Output: "cba"
 * ```
 *

 * @see {@link Combiner.flip} – the same operation on a plain `Combiner`
