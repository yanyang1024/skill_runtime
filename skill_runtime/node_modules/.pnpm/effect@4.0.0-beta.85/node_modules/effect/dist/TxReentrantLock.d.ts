 * Coordinates shared access inside transactions with read and write locks.

 * fiber, so a fiber that already holds the lock can acquire it again and later
 * release each acquisition. Attempts that cannot proceed retry transactionally
 * until the lock becomes available. This module includes manual, scoped, and
 * wrapper-style operations for read and write locking.
