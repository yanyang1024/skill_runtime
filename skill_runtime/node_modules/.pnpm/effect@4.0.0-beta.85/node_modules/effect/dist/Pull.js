/**
 * Models one low-level pull step for stream-like consumers.
 *
 * A `Pull<A, E, Done, R>` is an `Effect` that can produce one `A`, fail with an
 * ordinary error `E`, or signal end-of-input with `Cause.Done<Done>`. The
 * separate done signal lets low-level consumers distinguish normal completion
 * from failure. This module includes type extractors and helpers for detecting,
 * filtering, catching, converting, and matching done signals separately from
 * ordinary failures.
